# ModernAppsNinja Course & Lab Guide Staging Repo

This repository hosts new lab and course guides that are still under development or in preview. Lab Guides that have already been published but that have blocking bugs should also be placed on the staging repo until bugs are resolved. 

This repo can be used both by course or lab guide creators, or for individuals who are looking to collaborate and contribute. It is a good practice before creating a new lab guide to see if there is already something similar under development on the staging site to maximize efforts through collaboration with community peers!

Before creating a new course or lab guide, you will need to register the new guide in the [ModernAppsNinja Catalog](). For instructions on creating a new guide, please see the [Creating a new ModernAppsNinja Guide]() course.
