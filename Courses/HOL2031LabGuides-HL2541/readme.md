# Welcome Hands on Lab (HOL-2031) Users!

Please first complete all steps in Module 5 of the HOL-2031 lab guide, and then see below to find a list of additional lab guides that have been verified to work with the HOL-2031 lab environment.

## Overview

PKS Ninja Labs is a relatively new project within VMware that we have now extended through Hands On Labs to allow any user with HOL access to be able to use many of the lab guides available on the PKS Ninja Labs github repository. 

Please note, this is a user driven community and there is no full time staff dedicated to it, so all content and support is best effort. 

A key goal of PKS Ninja Labs is to funciton in a similar manner to an open source community, so while most participants may use the site to take advantage of lab guides, participants can also choose to get involved at all levels of the community, anyone can create their own courses and lab guides and benefit from the support of the community to help keep your lab guides up to date over time. 

You could also choose to learn and participate in our gitops and agile oriented processes, triaging or resolving issue tickets, learning to approve and commit merges and even become a site admin. Any participant is welcome to get as deeply involved in the project as they would like.

## Lab Guide support for HOL-2031   

Not all of the Lab Guides on this site will be compatible with the HOL-2031 lab environment. Because the HOL-2031 lab has NSX-T, the PKS Control Plane, and a kubernetes cluster pre-installed, HOL-2031 is not compatible with any lab guides dedicated to installing NSX-T, PKS or deploying a new Kubernetes cluster. 

HOL-2031 has limited internet access to only a few websites which is sufficient to complete most (post-installation) Lab Guides on the site; however, many lab guides were initially built by VMware employees on lab environments that do not have internet restrictions and several lab guides still have steps that require unrestricted internet access. We are currently in the process of updating all lab guides possible to be compatible with the HOL-2031 lab environment, and will post a list of lab guides here that have been confirmed to work with the HOL-2031 lab environment. 

There may be lab guides on the site not listed here that are already compatible, but that we have not yet had the chance to validate. If you would like to try other lab guides not listed on this page please feel free to do so but please not there may be some steps that are not possible to do from HOL-2031. If you do find any steps in any lab guides that are not compatible with HOL-2031, please open an issue ticket. If you do wanty to help out in the process of updating the lab guides for HOL-2031 that are not listed on this page it would be appreciated, and if you open tickets letting us know where you find problems, it will help us accelerate preparing materials for HOL-2031.
